  <p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've come to appreciate how each phase of my life has affected my creative abilities as I reflect of them.<sup> 1 </sup> Like how I grew from coloring as a child to painting colorful scenes, I've developed my expertise of digital tools to make my ideas come to life. <sup> 2 </sup> Through digital photography or graphic design software, the digital world has given me the opportunity to experiment with my artistic skills in new ways.<sup> 3 </sup>  It has improved my capacity to produce more visually appealing works.<sup> 4 </sup>  These encounters have improved my comprehension of how technology may enhance conventional abilities, enabling more depth and creativity.<sup> 5 </sup>  My growing passion for cartoons and movies has also developed into something deeper. <sup> 6 </sup> These days, I use my scriptwriting skills to craft compelling stories for online platforms.<sup> 7 </sup>  My storytelling has grown beyond standard methods to include short videos, podcasts, and even content for social media.<sup> 8 </sup>  I can present personalities and stories in a way that resonates to a larger audience due to the digital tools I use for filmmaking and video editing. <sup> 9 </sup> I began writing my own stories, creating characters that encountered and conquered obstacles. <sup> 10 </sup> In addition to providing me with entertainment, these stories gave me the chance to look further into themes of empowerment and survival.<sup> 11 </sup>  Also, my skills for photography has evolved into a digital medium that enables me to record memories with greater precision and clarity than ever before. <sup> 12 </sup> New opportunities for image editing and enhancement to produce more impactful graphics have been made possible by digital photography. <sup> 13 </sup> When I look back, I can see how every phase has shaped who I am now. <sup> 14 </sup> All of the skills I've developed, from my early interests to my present passions, have influenced my identity and perspective.<sup> 15 </sup>  I've been able to connect with others, share stories, and express myself in ways I never thought possible thanks to these abilities.<sup> 16 </sup>  I'm eager to explore where my abilities and imagination will lead me as I continue to explore all aspects of my life.<sup> 17 </sup>  As they say, "kapag may itinanim, may aanihin."<sup> 18</sup>  Lahat ng mga skills na ngayon ay ginagamit ko sa iba't-ibang bagay ay hindi lamang biglang tumubo ito ay tinatanim at inaalagaan hanggang sa lumaki at mapakinabangan sa mga magagandang bagay. <sup> 19</sup>Developing skills not only empowers us to face challenges but also opens up endless opportunities for personal growth and success.

  <p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found myself during my teenage years through hobbies.<sup> 1</sup> Habang lumalaki ako, lagi kong naiisip na may buong mundo sa labas ng kwarto ko na naghihintay na ma-explore. <sup> 2</sup>Kaya naging paraan ko ang hobbies para makonekta sa mundo. <sup> 3</sup>Hobbies opened my eyes to different things I could do in my free time, and they became my safe space.<sup> 4</sup> They gave me a sense of purpose and allowed me to express myself in ways that sometimes words couldn’t.<sup> 5</sup>
Isa sa pinaka-meaningful na hobbies na nadevelop ko ay journaling.<sup> 6</sup> Every morning, kapag may oras ako, I would sit down with my notebook, pen, and my collection of stickers.<sup>7</sup> At first, I simply liked decorating my journal, picking out stickers that had personal meaning to me, and arranging them creatively on the pages. <sup> 8</sup>Pero habang tumatagal, journaling became more than just an artistic hobby—it became my outlet for emotions.<sup> 9</sup>
I’m the type of person who sometimes struggles to talk about things that bother me. <sup> 10</sup>Whether it’s stress, sadness, or uncertainty, may mga moments na feeling ko wala akong malapitan.<sup> 11</sup> That’s when my journal became my safe space.<sup> 12</sup> Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I write everything down—my fears, my frustrations, my hopes.<sup> 13</sup> It’s like talking to a close friend who listens without judgment.<sup> 14</sup> And the best part is looking back at old entries and realizing how much I’ve grown. <sup> 15</sup>May mga araw na binabalikan ko ang mga old entries ko and I think, "I’m living the life I once only dreamed of, and my life is in a better place now compared to before."<sup> 16</sup>
Bukod sa journaling, reading has played a huge role in my personal growth.<sup> 17</sup> Isa sa pinakamalaking fears ko about growing up is the responsibility that comes with adulthood—paying bills, managing expenses, making financial decisions, and handling everything on my own. <sup> 18</sup>The thought of it all can be overwhelming, kaya naghanap ako ng guidance sa books. <sup> 20</sup>I came across financial advisors on social media who emphasized the importance of reading to expand one’s knowledge. <sup> 21</sup>Their advice stuck with me, kaya nagsimula akong magbasa ng books on personal finance, self-improvement, and life management.<sup> 22</sup> The more I read, the more I realized that knowledge is one of the most powerful tools a person can have.<sup> 23</sup> Books have taught me different perspectives on money management, personal growth, and how to carry myself confidently in the real world.<sup> 24</sup> They’ve opened my mind to possibilities and made adulthood feel less intimidating.<sup> 25</sup> I also love crocheting and altering clothes to match my personal style and vision. <sup> 26</sup>There’s something satisfying about taking a simple piece of fabric or yarn and transforming it into something unique and personal. <sup> 27</sup>Crocheting and altering clothes allow me to be creative while also being resourceful. <sup> 28</sup>Instead of buying new things all the time, I can upcycle and personalize what I already have.<sup> 29</sup> All of these hobbies have shaped who I am today. <sup> 30</sup> </p></div>

  <p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alam mo ‘yung feeling na gusto mo pang i-explore ang sarili mo at matuto ng mas maraming bagay? That’s exactly how I feel right now.<sup> 1</sup> I want to step out of my comfort zone and try new experiences that will help me grow. <sup> 2</sup>One of the things I have an interest is to learn is cooking. <sup> 3</sup>Right now, Siguro, I can only make basic meals siguro ‘yung madadali lang like fried dishes, simpleng pagbbake ng brownies and cookies at mga instant food or noodles. <sup> 4</sup>But I want to go beyond that. I want to learn how to balance flavors, experiment with ingredients, and cook dishes that are both delicious and healthy. <sup> 5</sup>Gusto ko rin ‘yung idea na one day, I can cook not just for myself but also for my family and friends.<sup>6</sup> There’s something special about preparing a meal and sharing it with the people you love.<sup>7</sup> I also want to try Pilates.<sup> 8</sup> I feel like it’s the perfect combination of fitness and relaxation. <sup> 8</sup>Out of all the exercises I could do, I think pilates is one of the best exercise I could do that would fit my body type.<sup> 9</sup> Hindi siya sobrang intense, but it still strengthens the body and improves flexibility. <sup> 10</sup>Sa dami ng stress sa araw-araw, I think having a workout routine that also helps clear the mind would be really beneficial.<sup> 11</sup> Of course, another big goal of mine is to explore more nature activities.<sup> 12</sup> Hindi lang ‘yung simpleng pasyal sa mall or coffee shop, but real outdoor adventures.<sup> 13</sup> I want to try mountain climbing, ang saya siguro ng feeling na kahit pagod ka at masugatan sa mga bato sa pag-akyat, sulit naman ‘yung view sa taas. <sup> 14</sup>I also want to travel more, not just as a tourist, but to truly experience different places like a local. <sup> 15</sup>Gusto ko ‘yung kakain sa mga sikat na karinderya na alam lang ng mga taga-roon, sumakay sa public transport nila, at maramdaman talaga ‘yung culture ng lugar. <sup> 16</sup>There are so many things I want to do and learn, and that’s what makes life exciting.<sup> 17</sup> Hindi lang siya tungkol sa bagong skills o experiences, kundi sa journey mismo, how each new experience shapes me and helps me become the person I want to be. <sup> 18</sup>Right now, my interest in life is to explore the world and gain new experiences. <sup> 19</sup>Interests that I can carry with me throughout my journey.<sup> 20</sup></p> </div>
