    <p align = "justify"><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are some sounds that I can only recall.<sup>1</sup> A specific type of quiet that is unique
  to memories.<sup>2</sup> A certain smell and a string of pictures flash through my head, transporting
  me to a time when I was younger and life was simpler.<sup>3</sup> I used to be a calm, reserved kid
  who enjoyed quietly observing the world, if I may say so.<sup>4</sup> No matter where my mother
  went, I would follow her.<sup>5</sup> I used to find a little spot where I could lose myself in my own
  world while she worked. <sup>6</sup> Even though we were in the same room, I lived in my own world
  and never gave much thought to the people or the commotion around me. <sup>8</sup> I placed my
  pens and coloring book beneath her desk. <sup>9</sup> For six-year-old Mikee, starting school was
  quite difficult because I was used to spending all of my time with my parents. <sup>10</sup> Since my
  teachers and classmates were all strangers to me, I would cry because I was afraid of
  their odd glances. <sup>11</sup> To get through first grade, I brought a big teddy bear to class, I called
  it teddy. <sup>12</sup> Teddy became the only friend I talked to all day—it was like my safe space.<sup>13</sup>
  Whenever I saw it sitting beside me, I felt protected and calm, as if it was an angel who
  looked after me. <sup>14</sup> Until I realized, there’s so much to explore in the world - there’s no
  reason for me to hide in the dark. <sup>15</sup> As the sun sank below rooftops, I changed into a joyful,
  carefree child who enjoyed running down familiar streets. <sup>16</sup> I started chasing sunsets like
  as a child. <sup>17</sup> <em>Walang ibang iniintindi kundi ang habulin ang araw at maglaro. <sup>18</sup> Tumakbo man
  sa ilalim ng init at lilim, umuwi man ako nang pawisan o may gasgas sa katawan o
  umakyat man ako sa mga puno, maglambitin sa bakal at gumagapang sa putikan kasama
  ang aking mga kaibigan. </em> <sup>19</sup> Back then, I believed everything—the people, the places, even
  the feelings—would last forever. <sup>20</sup> Now, All I can do is look back and realize that being a
    little girl was only the start of who I am today. <sup>21</sup></p>

    <p style="margin: 10px;"></p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My goal as a teenager was to do something special so that people would remember
  me. <sup>1</sup> But when faced with crucial choices, it was very easy to get lost. <sup>2</sup> Although I already
  had my teenage years planned out<sup>3</sup>Society had given me a detailed blueprint for how
  every adolescent girl should behave. <sup>4</sup> I would frequently lose myself in my own thoughts. <sup>5</sup>
  I was so busy with so many things and inundated with ideas that I was unable to even
  find the right words.<sup>6</sup> The pages of my journal began to wear <sup>7</sup> Small holes developing in
  the thin paper—tales of boys who drew me in and persuaded me to believe there was a
  spark. <sup>8</sup> Stories of friendships lost, crumpled like scores of unsent letters on the floor. <sup>9</sup> Tears
  welled up in my eyes as I remembered invitations that were not extended and remarks
  that were regrettably expressed—or not spoken adequately. <sup>10</sup> The fading of something
  once thought to stay forever symbolized my teenage high school years. <sup>11</sup> A time filled with
  unstable teenagers all attempting to survive the in-between existence of being neither a
  child nor an adult. <sup>12</sup> Teen drama in my life was like an ever-evolving soap opera with 12
  seasons, and my best friends and I were in the front row. <sup>13</sup> My long-term teenage
  friendships taught me almost all I know about life and love. <sup>14</sup> A embroidery of shared
  events and dreams woven across our lives, creating patterns of joy, understanding, and
  unconditional support. <sup>15</sup> In the vivid tapestry of my life, one thread stands out. <sup>16</sup> The
  connection that I have with my best friends, Juliana, Lara, Resha and Kristina. <sup>17</sup> Regardless
  of what the world offers us, I know that we always have each other’s backs. <sup>18</sup> Whether it’s
  about heartbreaks, failed relationships, someone we all despise, random outings, or
  spontaneous rants about life—it all became more beautiful and meaningful because it
  was with them. <sup>19</sup> Even after spending seven years as a teenager and now growing up, we
  will always be each other’s home.<sup>20</sup></p>

    <p><blockquote></blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone has hopes and dreams. <sup>1</sup> People fantasize about their future—whether it's
  becoming a scientist who discovers new and beautiful things or a star basketball player
  who becomes the highest-paid player in the league. <sup>2</sup> Like everyone else, I also have
  aspirations: dreams of a wonderful life with plenty of money, a good job, and peace. <sup>3</sup> In
  reality, my future seemed out of reach, as if it were on the next floor of a building while
  I rushed up an escalator. <sup>4</sup> The urge to turn around and stroll back down was
  overwhelming, but the sole direction was to run up, no matter how quickly I ran. <sup>5</sup> That
  setback reminded me that the future is always hanging. <sup>6</sup> Fear makes itself known—the
  feeling that I have failed myself, that little girl, and her hopes. <sup>7</sup> I had a plan that I dropped
  in a puddle of rain, and it was too late to save. <sup>8</sup>That is the truth of college life. <sup>9</sup> We must
  prioritize the future over happiness.<sup>10</sup> Just like I chose IT over any art course, even though
  I felt I belonged in art—where I could contribute my talents for the greater good. <sup>11</sup> "Don't
  blend in to fit in" was the phrase that helped me survive my first year of college. <sup>12</sup> Looking
  back to my freshman year, I realize how far I have ventured outside my comfort zone,
  despite the unknown anxieties that remain.<sup>13</sup> As they say, <em> “Oh! College na, IT is the best
  course, andyan ang future.” </em> <sup>14</sup>Maybe it's not a bad idea to choose new things. <sup>15</sup>You will
  learn new things that are beyond your scope. <sup>16</sup>Meet people with perspectives different
  from those you usually encounter, and open your eyes to new opportunities, skills, and
  environments. <sup>17</sup> Perhaps, in another universe where the stars align and in another lifetime,
  there is a version of me in that art course I once promised myself. <sup>18</sup> For now, I am a BSIT
  student, dreaming that when college life ends, this course will benefit me as much as I
  fought with every bone in my body to get through it. <sup>19</sup>Just as some gardens bloom under
  watchful eyes, others grow in shadows, leaving petals to open cautiously, never certain
  if warmth will linger or fade. <sup>20</sup></p>
